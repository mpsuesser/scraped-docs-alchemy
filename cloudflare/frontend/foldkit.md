[Foldkit](https://foldkit.dev) is an Elm-architecture frontend
framework built on Effect. Its apps are client-only Vite projects —
the Foldkit Vite plugin only adds HMR and devtools wiring — so
[`Cloudflare.Website.Vite`](/cloudflare/frontend/vite) deploys them
with a single declaration: no `main` entrypoint, no build command,
no output directory, no Wrangler configuration.

## vite.config.ts

Your Vite config stays what Foldkit's setup gives you:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import { foldkit } from "@foldkit/vite-plugin";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [foldkit()],
  optimizeDeps: {
    entries: ["src/entry.ts"],
  },
});
```

Alchemy runs Vite programmatically on the project root and layers
its Cloudflare integration on top of this config — the Foldkit
plugin and the rest of your setup are preserved as-is.

## Deploy it from a Stack

Yield the Vite resource from your Stack — this is
[examples/cloudflare-foldkit](https://github.com/alchemy-run/alchemy/tree/main/examples/cloudflare-foldkit)
verbatim:

```typescript
// alchemy.run.ts
import * as Alchemy from "alchemy";
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";

export default Alchemy.Stack(
  "CloudflareFoldkitExample",
  {
    providers: Cloudflare.providers(),
    state: Cloudflare.state(),
  },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const worker = yield* Cloudflare.Website.Vite("Foldkit", {
      compatibility: {
        flags: ["nodejs_compat"],
      },
      memo: {},
      assets: {
        notFoundHandling: "single-page-application",
      },
    });

    return {
      url: worker.url,
    };
  }),
);
```

Every prop is optional — a bare `Cloudflare.Website.Vite("Foldkit")`
deploys too; Alchemy builds the client assets and serves them from a
Worker at the returned `url`.

## Deep links

A Foldkit app that uses URL routing (`Runtime.makeApplication` with
`route`, `onUrlRequest`, and `onUrlChange`) resolves routes on the
client, so a deep link like `/counter/42` arrives at the server as a
request for a file that doesn't exist. The
`notFoundHandling: "single-page-application"` setting above returns
`index.html` for unmatched paths instead of a 404, and the Foldkit
runtime resolves the route once the app boots.

## Wire in a backend URL

A Foldkit SPA has no server, so anything it needs from the rest of
your Stack is baked into the bundle at build time — pass a
`VITE_`-prefixed key in `env` and read it as
`import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` in your Foldkit code (e.g. from a
`Command` that fetches it):

```diff lang="typescript"
// alchemy.run.ts
const worker = yield* Cloudflare.Website.Vite("Foldkit", {
+  env: {
+    VITE_API_URL: backend.url,
+  },
});
```

See [Environment](/cloudflare/frontend/vite#environment) for the
full inlining semantics.

## Deploy

```sh
bun alchemy deploy
```

## Local dev

```sh
bun alchemy dev
```

`alchemy dev` boots Vite's own dev server, so you keep Foldkit's
HMR (with model preservation across edits) while Alchemy wires in
the same env values as a deploy.

:::note[Pinned Effect versions]
Foldkit pins its `effect` peer dependency to an exact version.
Alchemy runs your app's own Vite build with your app's own
`node_modules`, so that pin is between Foldkit and your package
manager — Alchemy imposes no Effect version on your frontend.
