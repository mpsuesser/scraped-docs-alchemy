`Cloudflare.Website.SvelteKit` deploys a [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit) app as a Cloudflare Worker. It builds the app with SvelteKit’s own Vite pipeline and a wrangler-free in-memory Cloudflare adapter, then re-bundles the server output for workerd. Client assets and prerendered pages deploy as Worker static assets; dynamic routes are served by the generated Worker. There is no `svelte.config.js` to write, no `@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare` to install, and no Wrangler file.

## Install

The build integration is not bundled with alchemy — the resource dynamically imports `@distilled.cloud/sveltekit` from your project at deploy time, so it must be installed alongside your framework. It is only used at build time, so a dev dependency is enough:

```sh
bun add -d @distilled.cloud/sveltekit
```

## Configure SvelteKit

There is no framework config to write. The resource drives SvelteKit’s Vite pipeline programmatically and injects its own Cloudflare adapter, so a fresh SvelteKit project deploys as-is. Options that would normally live in `svelte.config.js` are passed via the `kit` prop instead — see [Kit and adapter options](#kit-and-adapter-options) below.

## Declare the Website

Declare the site as a module-level const (rather than inline in the Stack) and derive the typed shape of its bindings from it:

```typescript
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";

export const Website = Cloudflare.Website.SvelteKit("Website");

export type WebsiteEnv = Cloudflare.InferEnv<typeof Website>;
```

`WebsiteEnv` is the typed shape of the Worker’s bindings, derived from the class — you’ll import it into your SvelteKit code in [Read bindings in server code](#read-bindings-in-server-code).

## Add it to the Stack

Yield the class from your Stack and return its URL:

```typescript
import * as Alchemy from "alchemy";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";

export default Alchemy.Stack(
  "MySvelteKitSite",
  {
    providers: Cloudflare.providers(),
    state: Cloudflare.state(),
  },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const site = yield* Website;
    return { url: site.url };
  }),
);
```

SvelteKit’s server code is built for Node, so the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag is added automatically — you don’t need to pass it.

See [examples/cloudflare-website-sveltekit](https://github.com/alchemy-run/alchemy/tree/main/examples/cloudflare-website-sveltekit) for the checked-in example.

## Add bindings

The resource returns a plain `Worker`, so `env` accepts the full binding vocabulary — KV namespaces, R2 buckets, Durable Objects, secrets:

```typescript
import * as Config from "effect/Config";

export const Cache = Cloudflare.KV.Namespace("Cache");

export const Website = Cloudflare.Website.SvelteKit("Website", {
  env: {
    CACHE: Cache,
    API_KEY: Config.redacted("API_KEY"),
  },
});
```

`Cache` is a description, not a deploy — Alchemy provisions the real namespace because the Website binds it. `Config.redacted` reads `API_KEY` from your environment at deploy time and binds it as a Worker secret — see [Secrets & env](../security/secrets-env.md).

## Read bindings in server code

Server routes read bindings through SvelteKit’s `platform.env`. Type it once by augmenting `App.Platform` with the inferred env type:

```typescript
import type { WebsiteEnv } from "../alchemy.run.ts";

declare global {
  namespace App {
    interface Platform {
      env: WebsiteEnv;
    }
  }
}

export {};
```

Every server route now gets fully typed bindings:

```typescript
export const load = async ({ platform }) => {
  const cached = await platform?.env?.CACHE.get("greeting");
  return { greeting: cached ?? "hello" };
};
```

`platform.env.CACHE` is typed as a KV namespace and `platform.env.API_KEY` as a string — renaming a binding in `alchemy.run.ts` is a type error in your routes.

## Kit and adapter options

Since kit v3 the configuration lives in memory — pass it via the `kit` prop instead of a `svelte.config.js`. The generated Cloudflare adapter is configured via `adapter`:

```typescript
export const Website = Cloudflare.Website.SvelteKit("Website", {
  kit: {
    alias: { $lib: "src/lib" },
  },
  adapter: {
    notFoundHandling: "404-page",
    fallback: "spa",
  },
});
```

Don’t set `kit.adapter` — Alchemy injects its own wrangler-free Cloudflare adapter.

## Local dev

```sh
bun alchemy dev
```

`alchemy dev` runs SvelteKit’s own Vite dev server — Node SSR with full HMR. `platform.env` carries the Worker’s real Cloudflare bindings, served wrangler-free through the cloudflare-runtime platform proxy: calls like `platform.env.CACHE.get(...)` round-trip to a local workerd instance, so dev state is live and shared. Literal `env` values (strings and secrets) overlay the proxied bindings. Your server code is identical in dev and production.
