Everything you need before deploying to Fly.io: the alchemy package, a Fly organization, and an API token stored in a profile.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (recommended) or Node.js 22+
- A [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) account
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for [Services](https://alchemy.run/fly/compute/services) (Alchemy builds and pushes an image). Raw [Machines](https://alchemy.run/fly/compute/machines) with a public image do not need it. Neither do [Sprites](https://alchemy.run/fly/compute/sprites).

## Create a Fly organization

Sign in at [fly.io/dashboard](https://fly.io/dashboard). A personal org is created with the account. Tokens are scoped to an org — the org slug is what `Fly.App` uses when you omit `orgSlug` (Alchemy reads it from the current token).

## Generate an API token

In the dashboard:

1. Open **Account** → **Access Tokens** (or run `fly tokens create org` if you have [flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/)).
2. Create an **organization** token with permission to manage Apps and Machines.
3. Copy the token — Fly shows it **only once**.

The official environment variable is `FLY_API_TOKEN`. That token is enough for Apps, Machines, Services, Sprites, Postgres, Redis, and Tigris. Alchemy mints a Sprites bearer from it when you deploy a Sprite.

## Create a project directory

```sh
mkdir my-app && cd my-app && bun init -y
```

## Install

```sh
bun add "alchemy@latest" "effect@rc" "@effect/platform-bun@rc" "@effect/platform-node@rc"
```

## Connect alchemy to Fly

There is no separate credentials step. The first time you run `alchemy deploy` (or `plan`, `dev`, `destroy`) on a stack that uses `Fly.providers()`, alchemy walks you through an interactive login with two options:

- **API Token** — paste the token you generated above. It’s verified against the Machines API and saved under `~/.alchemy/credentials/<profile>/`.
- **Environment Variables** — reads `FLY_API_TOKEN` from the environment on every run (plus an optional `FLY_API_HOSTNAME` to override the Machines API root, default `https://api.machines.dev/v1`). This is the method for CI — when alchemy detects `CI=true` it skips the prompt and uses the environment automatically.

Either choice is saved to your **`default`** [profile](../environments/profiles.md) and reused on every subsequent command.

To re-run the setup later (e.g. to rotate the token, or configure a separate `prod` profile):

```sh
alchemy login --configure
alchemy login --profile prod --configure
```

Inspect what’s stored (secrets are redacted):

```sh
alchemy profile show
```

## State storage

Fly has no object-storage state backend of its own, so pick one of:

- **`Alchemy.localState()`** — state on disk under `.alchemy/` next to your code. Zero setup; right for solo projects and trying things out.
- **A cloud state store** — if you also use Cloudflare or AWS, pass `Cloudflare.state()` or `AWS.state()` so state is shared with your team and CI. See [State Store](../state-store.md).

## Next steps

- [Tutorial part 1](https://alchemy.run/fly/tutorial/part-1) — deploy your first App.
- [Sprites](https://alchemy.run/fly/compute/sprites) — an Effect program that hibernates. No Docker.
