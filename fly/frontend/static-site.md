`Fly.Website.StaticSite` runs a build command, content-hashes the
output directory, and deploys a [Service](https://alchemy.run/fly/compute/services)
that serves those files (plus `GET /health`) from a tiny Node
static-file server. Use it when the site has its own build step —
Hugo, Zola, Eleventy, or any custom pipeline.

For Vite-based projects, prefer [`Fly.Website.Vite`](vite.md).

## Declare the Website

`build.command` and `build.output` are required. Declare the site
as a module-level const:

```typescript
// alchemy.run.ts
import * as Fly from "alchemy/Fly";

export const Website = Fly.Website.StaticSite("Website", {
  build: { command: "hugo --minify", output: "public" },
});
```

The build is a [`Command.Build`](https://alchemy.run/providers/command/build) —
memoized, so unchanged inputs skip the rebuild
([details](../../command/memoization.md)). By default every non-gitignored
file in `path` (plus the nearest lockfile) is hashed. Narrow it with
`memo: { include: [...] }`, or set `memo: false` to rebuild on every
deploy.

## Add it to the Stack

Yield the site from your Stack and return its URL:

```typescript
// alchemy.run.ts
import * as Alchemy from "alchemy";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";

export default Alchemy.Stack(
  "MyStaticSite",
  {
    providers: Fly.providers(),
    state: Alchemy.localState(),
  },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const site = yield* Website;
    return { url: site.url };
  }),
);
```

One `StaticSite` expands into a [Fly App](https://alchemy.run/fly/compute/apps)
(created if you omit `app`), a Service running Node on a Machine
(port 3000), and a shared IPv4 so `https://{app}.fly.dev` answers.
Built files are packed at `/app/dist`. `site.url` is that fly.dev
URL (or `https://{domain}` when you pass `domain`). `app`,
`service`, `ip`, and `certificate` are undefined during
`alchemy dev`.

Pass `app` to put the site on an App you already declared:

```typescript
export const Site = Fly.App("Site");

export const Website = Fly.Website.StaticSite("Website", {
  build: { command: "hugo --minify", output: "public" },
  app: Site,
});
```

## Building from a subdirectory

`path` is the working directory for `build.command`. `build.output`
is relative to `path` (default: process cwd):

```typescript
export const Website = Fly.Website.StaticSite("Web", {
  path: "apps/web",
  build: { command: "npm run build", output: "dist" },
});
```

## SPAs and 404 pages

A miss — a request that matches no output file — can be answered two
ways, and they are mutually exclusive:

```typescript
// Single-page app: misses serve index.html with a 200 so the
// client-side router takes over.
export const App = Fly.Website.StaticSite("App", {
  build: { command: "npm run build", output: "dist" },
  assets: { notFoundHandling: "single-page-application" },
});

// Static site: misses return a real 404 status with your error page.
export const Docs = Fly.Website.StaticSite("Docs", {
  build: { command: "hugo --minify", output: "public" },
  assets: { notFoundHandling: "404-page" },
});
```

## Add environment variables

Top-level `env` is copied onto `process.env` for the build and onto
the Machine at deploy. Wrap secrets with `Redacted`. It is not
Worker bindings and not AWS `server.environment`:

```diff lang="typescript"
export const Website = Fly.Website.StaticSite("Website", {
  build: { command: "hugo --minify", output: "public" },
+  env: {
+    HUGO_ENV: "production",
+  },
});
```

Generators that inline at build time pick these up. The hosted
process is the generated static-file server — there is no framework
SSR runtime.

## Local development

During `alchemy dev`, `dev.command` replaces the build with that
process as a long-lived child. No Fly App, Service, IP, or
certificate is created, and `site.url` is the local address
detected from stdout (`dev.url` pins it when detection fails).
`dev` also accepts `cwd` and `env` overrides:

```typescript
export const Website = Fly.Website.StaticSite("Website", {
  build: { command: "hugo --minify", output: "public" },
  dev: { command: "hugo server" },
});
```

Without `dev.command`, the site still builds and a local static
server serves `outdir` — still no cloud resources. Wrap the site in
`Alchemy.remote()` to deploy the live path even during dev:

```typescript
export const Website = Fly.Website.StaticSite("Website", {
  build: { command: "hugo --minify", output: "public" },
}).pipe(Alchemy.remote());
```

## Custom domain

`domain` is a hostname string. Alchemy requests ACME
([`Fly.Certificate`](https://alchemy.run/providers/fly/certificate)) on the App and
`url` becomes `https://{domain}`. Point DNS at the App yourself —
v1 does not create records:

```typescript
export const Website = Fly.Website.StaticSite("Website", {
  build: { command: "hugo --minify", output: "public" },
  domain: "blog.example.com",
});
```

See [IPs & certificates](https://alchemy.run/fly/networking) for A/AAAA records and
the ACME challenge.

## When to use a framework resource instead

`StaticSite` is the general fallback for any shell command that
produces a directory of files. Frameworks with dedicated resources
have a better path: [Astro](astro.md),
[Foldkit](foldkit.md), [Next.js](nextjs.md),
[Nuxt](nuxt.md), [Octane](octane.md),
[React Router](react-router.md),
[SolidStart](solidstart.md),
[SvelteKit](sveltekit.md),
[TanStack Start](tanstack-start.md),
[Vite](vite.md),
[Vocs](vocs.md), and [Waku](waku.md). Those
resources run the framework's own programmatic build and skip the
`build.command` / `build.output` contract. Reach for `StaticSite`
when there is no dedicated resource — Zola, Hugo, or any other
generator.
