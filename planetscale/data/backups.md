Alchemy doesn't manage PlanetScale backup schedules — create backups
in the PlanetScale dashboard or via the API. What it gives you is the
restore side: point a new branch at a backup and it comes up with that
backup's schema and data.

Both `MySQLBranch` and `PostgresBranch` accept the same two props:
`backupId` restores a specific backup, `seedData` restores the parent
branch's last successful backup.

## Restore a branch from a backup

Pass the backup's ID as `backupId`. `clusterSize` is required when
restoring from a backup:

```typescript
const restored = yield* Planetscale.MySQLBranch("restored", {
  database,
  parentBranch: "main",
  isProduction: true,
  backupId: "backup-123",
  clusterSize: "PS_10",
});
```

The branch is created from `parentBranch` with the backup's schema and
data restored into it, then waits until it's ready like any other
branch. Grab the ID from the backup's page in the PlanetScale
dashboard or the backups API, and make sure the backup has completed
(state `success`) before deploying.

## Seed from the last successful backup

When you don't care which backup — just "recent production data" —
use `seedData` instead of pinning an ID:

```typescript
const preview = yield* Planetscale.MySQLBranch("preview", {
  database,
  parentBranch: "main",
  isProduction: false,
  seedData: "last_successful_backup",
});
```

This is the usual choice for preview and development branches that
want realistic data without tracking backup IDs in code.

## Create-only semantics

Both props apply only when the branch is first created. If the branch
already exists, `backupId` and `seedData` are ignored — subsequent
deploys sync the branch's other settings (production status,
`clusterSize`, `safeMigrations`) but never re-restore data. Changing
`backupId` on a deployed branch is a no-op, not a replacement.

To restore again, create a new branch: give the resource a new logical
ID (or a new `name`) so the next deploy creates a fresh branch from
the backup.

## Where next

- [MySQL](mysql.md) — databases, branches, and passwords.
- [Postgres](postgres.md) — the PostgreSQL side, including
  roles.
- [Migrations](migrations.md) — schema migrations and seed
  files per branch.
